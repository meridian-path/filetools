      q: 'What exactly gets encoded?',
      answerHtml: 'By default, only the five characters that are meaningful in HTML markup: <code>&amp;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>"</code>, and <code>\'</code>. Turn on “Also encode accented letters, symbols, and emoji” to convert every character above plain ASCII too - useful when you need output that only ever contains ASCII bytes.',

      q: 'Which entity format does the encoder use?',
      answerHtml: 'Choose from three: a named entity where one exists for that character (<code>&amp;copy;</code>), a numeric decimal entity (<code>&amp;#169;</code>), or a numeric hex entity (<code>&amp;#xA9;</code>). A character with no matching named entity always falls back to its numeric form, even in named mode.',

    {
      q: 'What happens to an entity the decoder doesn’t recognize?',
      answerHtml: 'It’s left exactly as it appeared in the input, unchanged - the decoder never guesses at malformed or unknown markup. That covers a misspelled named entity and a numeric entity outside the valid Unicode range alike.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is decoded output ever rendered as live HTML?',
      answerHtml: 'No. The decoded result is always shown and downloaded as plain text. If it contains something that looks like a tag - decoding <code>&amp;lt;script&amp;gt;</code> produces the literal text <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> - that text is displayed as text, never executed or inserted as markup.',
