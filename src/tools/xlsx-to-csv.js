      q: 'What about the older .xls format?',
      answerHtml: 'This tool reads .xlsx, the Open XML format Excel has used since 2007, not the older binary .xls format. Re-save an .xls file as .xlsx in Excel, LibreOffice, or Google Sheets first, then convert it here.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does it handle dates correctly?',
      answerHtml: 'Yes, for the common case: a cell formatted as a date or date-time in the workbook is converted to a readable date (YYYY-MM-DD, or YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS if it carries a time) rather than the raw serial number spreadsheets store internally.',

    {
      q: 'What if a sheet is hidden, or the workbook has formulas?',
      answerHtml: 'Hidden sheets are skipped, matching what you’d normally see when you open the file. A formula cell exports its last-calculated value, exactly what a plain CSV export from Excel itself would show; the formula text itself is not exported.',

      q: 'Is a password-protected workbook supported?',
      answerHtml: 'No. An encrypted or password-protected .xlsx can’t be read without the password, and this tool never asks for one. Remove the password in Excel first, then convert the file here.',
