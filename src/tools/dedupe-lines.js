    'Drop or choose a .txt or .csv file, or paste a list directly into the text box.',

  faqs: [
    {
      q: 'Is my list or file sent anywhere?',
      answerHtml: 'No. Pasted text and uploaded files are both read entirely on your device - nothing is sent to a server. Turn off your Wi-Fi after the page loads and it still works.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How does it decide two lines are duplicates?',
      answerHtml: 'By exact text match, line by line - not a fuzzy or “looks similar” match. <code>foo</code> and <code>&nbsp;foo</code> (with a leading space) count as different lines unless you turn on “ignore surrounding whitespace”, and <code>Apple</code> and <code>apple</code> count as different unless you turn on “ignore case”. This is deliberate: silently treating visually different lines as identical would be a surprising thing for a dedup tool to do without being asked.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does this work on a CSV file, not just a plain list?',
      answerHtml: 'Yes - each row of a CSV is compared as one line of text, so a row that exactly repeats (every column, in order) is removed the same way a repeated plain-text line is. The one case this does not specially parse is a quoted CSV field that itself contains a line break; a row like that is treated as more than one line, the same way a plain text editor would show it.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Which occurrence of a duplicate is kept?',
      answerHtml: 'The first one. Everything after the first occurrence of an exact-match duplicate is removed; the file’s original row order is otherwise preserved.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to blank lines?',
      answerHtml: 'By default, blank lines are deduped like any other line - five blank lines in a row become one. Turn on “skip blank lines” to remove all of them from the output instead.',
