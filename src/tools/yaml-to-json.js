      answerHtml: 'JSON itself has no way to represent infinity or “not a number” - most converters silently turn these into <code>null</code>, quietly losing the original value. This tool writes them out as the visible JSON strings <code>"Infinity"</code>, <code>"-Infinity"</code>, and <code>"NaN"</code> instead, so nothing disappears without a trace.',
