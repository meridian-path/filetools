      answerHtml: 'No. Pasted JSON and uploaded files are both read entirely on your device: nothing is sent to a server. Turn off your Wi-Fi after the page loads and it still works.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How are nested objects turned into flat keys?',
      answerHtml: 'Each level of nesting is joined with your chosen delimiter. With the default dot delimiter, <code>{"user":{"name":"Ada"}}</code> flattens to a single key <code>user.name</code> with value <code>Ada</code>. Choose underscore or slash instead if that suits your spreadsheet or downstream tool better.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to arrays?',
      answerHtml: 'By default each array item gets its own numbered key, so <code>{"roles":["admin","editor"]}</code> becomes <code>roles.0</code> and <code>roles.1</code>. Turn off “give array items their own numbered key” to keep each array as a single JSON value instead. That’s useful when an array is really one piece of data (like a list of tags) rather than something you want spread across columns.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I flatten a list of records at once, not just one object?',
      answerHtml: 'Yes. If the top level of your JSON is an array where every item is an object (a typical API response or export), each item becomes one row of a table, with every field it contains as a column. Download that as CSV to open it straight in a spreadsheet, or as JSON to get the same flattened records back as an array.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if two records in my array have different fields?',
      answerHtml: 'Every field seen across any record becomes a column; a record that doesn’t have a given field just gets an empty cell there, the same way a missing or <code>null</code> value is shown.',
