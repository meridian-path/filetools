    },
    {
      q: 'What counts as a “word”?',
      answerHtml: 'A run of letters or digits, allowing one internal apostrophe or hyphen so a contraction like <code>don’t</code> or a compound like <code>well-known</code> counts as a single word. Punctuation, quotation marks, and whitespace are treated as breaks between words, not part of them.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is counting case-sensitive?',
      answerHtml: '“Ignore case” is on by default, so <code>The</code> and <code>the</code> count as the same word. Turn it off if you want <code>USA</code> and <code>usa</code> tracked separately.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Can I filter out common words like “the” and “and”?',
      answerHtml: 'Turn on “exclude common words” to drop a short, fixed list of very frequent English function words (articles, pronouns, prepositions, and similar) from the table, so what is left is closer to the text’s actual subject matter. This list is not exhaustive and is English-only.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How are ties in the ranking broken?',
      answerHtml: 'Words with the same count are listed alphabetically, so the table order stays stable and predictable no matter how you re-run the same text.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Does it count numbers as words?',
      answerHtml: 'Yes, by default a run of digits counts as a word, so <code>2026</code> is counted. Turn on “exclude numbers” to drop number-only entries from the table.',
