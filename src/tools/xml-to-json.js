    {
      q: 'Is my XML sent anywhere?',
      answerHtml: 'No. Pasted XML and uploaded files are both read and converted entirely on your device, using your browser’s own XML parser - nothing is sent to a server. Turn off your Wi-Fi after the page loads and it still works.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How are attributes and text represented in the JSON?',
      answerHtml: 'Each attribute becomes a key prefixed with <code>@</code> - <code>&lt;item id="5"&gt;</code> becomes <code>"@id": "5"</code>. An element’s own text (outside its child elements) becomes a <code>#text</code> key when that element also has attributes or child elements; an element with only text becomes a plain JSON string. The document’s root element becomes the single top-level key of the result.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to repeated elements?',
      answerHtml: 'Sibling elements sharing the same tag name become a JSON array, in the order they appear - <code>&lt;items&gt;&lt;item&gt;A&lt;/item&gt;&lt;item&gt;B&lt;/item&gt;&lt;/items&gt;</code> becomes <code>{"item": ["A", "B"]}</code>. A tag that appears only once stays a single value, not a one-item array.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Are numbers and true/false converted to their own JSON types?',
      answerHtml: 'No, on purpose. XML has no type system of its own, so every value - element text and attribute values alike - stays a JSON string. Guessing types silently changes data a visitor didn’t ask to change: a ZIP code like <code>00501</code> auto-converted to the number <code>501</code> loses its leading zero. This tool never does that.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if my XML has a <!DOCTYPE> declaration?',
      answerHtml: 'It’s refused with a clear message rather than parsed. A <!DOCTYPE> can define custom entities, and resolving those safely and identically across every browser isn’t something this tool can guarantee - refusing the whole document up front closes off that risk rather than relying on it never coming up. Remove the <!DOCTYPE ...> line (most real-world XML - API responses, config files, RSS - doesn’t have one) and try again.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if my XML has a syntax error?',
      answerHtml: 'You’ll get a plain-English error naming the problem instead of a converted file, or a silent blank result. Fix the tags at that spot and try again.',
