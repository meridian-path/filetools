  // Registration fragment (2026-08-22 fragment-pattern refactor): this
  // tool's own row in what used to be four hand-maintained shared maps
  // (src/families.js's FAMILY_BY_SLUG, src/icons.js's MARKS,
  // src/pages/toolPage.js + src/browser/dropzone.client.js's
  // MAX_BYTES_BY_CLIENT/PASTE_FILE). src/families.js/icons.js/
  // browserClients.js now assemble those structures FROM the TOOLS
  // registry (src/tools/index.js already auto-discovers this file) --
  // see those three files' own header comments for the assembly step and
  // src/browser/dropzone.client.js's comment for why the browser-facing
  // maps are generated at build time instead. A new tool adds its own
  // src/tools/<slug>.js with these same fields; no existing tool's file
  // changes, so two tool branches can never conflict here.
  //   family: this tool's presentational family (families.js's
  //     familyOf() rule: input format's family, else output's).
  //   folder: this tool's DISPLAY folder for nav/home/folder-pages/footer
  //     (folders.js's folderOf()) -- independent of `category` (the URL
  //     prefix, which never changes) and independent of `family` (the
  //     icon color axis); see folders.js's own header comment for the
  //     full taxonomy and why the two axes are kept separate.
  //   mark: { verb, ink?, motif? } -- icons.js's per-slug MARKS row,
  //     minus `plate` (always === family, see icons.js). `ink` defaults
  //     to `family` when omitted (a same-family tool like this one).
  //   maxBytes: this tool's clientEntry's per-file size cap. Every other
  //     tool sharing this same clientEntry (pdf-split.js, pdf-rotate.js)
  //     must declare the identical value -- browserClients.js asserts
  //     that at build time so a mismatch fails loudly, not silently.
  //   pasteFile: only present on a tool with `pasteInput` below --
  //     name/type of the synthetic File a pasted submission is wrapped
  //     in before it reaches this clientEntry's processor.
