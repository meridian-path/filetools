      answerHtml: 'A row is treated as a header if every one of its cells is a <code>&lt;th&gt;</code>, which is how most real-world tables mark their header row. Use the checkbox above the table to override it either way - the JSON export uses whichever row is currently marked as the header for its field names.',
