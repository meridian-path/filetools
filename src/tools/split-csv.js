  howSteps: [
    'Drop or choose a .csv file, or paste CSV text directly into the text box.',
    'Set “Rows per file” - the file list updates immediately to show exactly which files you’ll get and how many rows land in each.',
    'Leave “First row is a header” on (the default) to repeat the header as the first row of every file, or turn it off to split purely by position.',
    'Download the zip - every piece is a complete, standalone .csv.',
  ],
  faqs: [
    {
      q: 'Does the header row count toward the rows-per-file number?',
      answerHtml: 'No. “Rows per file” counts data rows only - with the header option on, each file gets the header row <em>plus</em> up to that many data rows. Splitting 250 data rows into files of 100 gives you three files: 100, 100, and 50 rows, each with the header on top.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What are the files in the zip called?',
      answerHtml: 'They take the original file’s name with a numbered suffix - <code>orders.csv</code> split three ways becomes <code>orders-part-01.csv</code>, <code>orders-part-02.csv</code>, <code>orders-part-03.csv</code>. The numbers are zero-padded so the files sort in the right order in any file manager.',
    },
    {
      q: 'How are quoted fields with commas or line breaks inside them handled?',
      answerHtml: 'Correctly - this tool reads the whole file with a full CSV parser, so a quoted field like <code>"Smith, John"</code> or a quoted field containing its own line break is kept as one field of one row. That matters more for splitting than almost any other CSV operation: a tool that split on raw line breaks would cut a multi-line field in half and corrupt both output files around it.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Why would I split a CSV at all?',
      answerHtml: 'The usual reasons: a tool or form that caps how many rows it accepts per import (many CRM, email, and e-commerce importers stop at 500–10,000 rows), a spreadsheet that struggles with a very large file, or sharing a big export in reviewable pieces. Set “Rows per file” to whatever your importer’s limit is and each piece comes out ready to load.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Do you upload my file anywhere?',
      answerHtml: 'No. The file is read, split, and zipped entirely on your device. Turn off your Wi-Fi after the page loads and it still works.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to blank lines?',
      answerHtml: 'Rows whose cells are all empty are dropped rather than carried into an output file - they’d otherwise waste a slot in a row-count split and show up as empty lines mid-file. Rows with any real content are kept exactly as they are.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is there a limit on file size or how many pieces I can make?',
      answerHtml: 'The input file is capped at a generous size (shown on the drop zone) so a single huge file can’t freeze the tab, and one split is capped at 2,000 output files - if your settings would produce more, the tool says so and asks you to raise “Rows per file” rather than silently building a zip your browser can’t handle.',
