    },
    {
      q: 'What JSON shape does this expect?',
      answerHtml: 'A top-level array of objects, like <code>[ {"name": "Coffee", "price": 4.50}, {"name": "Tea", "price": 3.25} ]</code>. A single object, or an array of anything else (numbers, strings), isn’t rejected outright (each non-object item just becomes a single-column row named "value"), but an array of flat objects is what produces the most useful spreadsheet.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What happens to nested objects and arrays?',
      answerHtml: 'A nested object is flattened into dot-notation columns - <code>{"address": {"city": "Reno"}}</code> becomes a column named <code>address.city</code>. A nested array is kept as-is, written into its cell as compact JSON text (e.g. <code>["red","blue"]</code>), rather than expanded into extra columns - that keeps the column count predictable no matter how many items a nested array happens to have.',
    },
    {
      q: 'What if different objects in the array have different fields?',
      answerHtml: 'Every field seen across every object gets its own column, in the order it first appears. An object missing a given field just gets a blank cell there, rather than shifting the other columns out of place.',
    },
    {
      q: 'Is the CSV safe to open in Excel or Sheets?',
      answerHtml: 'Yes - any cell value that would otherwise be interpreted as a spreadsheet formula (starting with <code>=</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>@</code>, or a tab) is automatically neutralized with a leading quote before download, the same protection used across every CSV export on this site.',
