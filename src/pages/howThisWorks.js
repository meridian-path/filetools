    <p class="deck">Every tool on this site runs entirely inside your browser. Here’s exactly what that means and how you can check it yourself.</p>

    <h2>Nothing you process is ever sent anywhere</h2>
    <p>When you choose or drop a file, it’s read directly by your browser’s own JavaScript engine. The libraries that do the actual work (merging pages, splitting a document, rotating a page) are downloaded once from this site and then run on your device using your device’s own processing power. Your file’s contents never travel over the network at any point.</p>
    <p>You can verify this yourself: open a tool page, let it finish loading, then turn off your Wi-Fi or unplug your network cable. The tool still works, because by that point your browser already has everything it needs downloaded and running locally - the network was only ever needed to fetch the page itself.</p>

    <h2>What does leave your device</h2>
    <p>Two things, and we’d rather say so plainly than let a privacy pitch overstate itself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>A page-view count.</strong> This site uses GoatCounter, a privacy-focused analytics service, to count visits. It doesn’t use cookies or collect personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising.</strong> This site runs Google AdSense to help cover its costs. AdSense may set its own cookies and use data according to Google’s own policies, which we don’t control.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Neither of those has anything to do with the files you process; that part genuinely never leaves your device. Full detail on both: see the <a href="${url('privacy/')}">privacy page</a>.</p>

    <h2>Why build it this way</h2>
    <p>Most free PDF and file tools work by sending your file to a server, doing the work there, and sending a result back. That’s simpler to build, but it means a copy of your file, which might be a contract, a statement, or anything else you didn’t necessarily want to hand to a third party, passes through someone else’s infrastructure. Running everything in the browser means that step just doesn’t exist.</p>
